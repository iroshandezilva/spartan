# Spartan Design System

Code-owned design system using Lit, Storybook, and a custom Figma token plugin.

Project documentation and tasks live in Linear:

- [Documentation home](https://linear.app/wearehaux/document/spartant-design-system-project-home-5730425b4e0d)
- [Project issues](https://linear.app/wearehaux/project/spartant-design-system-b4328c010ac8/overview)

Each component has one Linear issue with separate `Dev: ...` and `Figma: ...` labels. Both must be Done for overall completion. Other work uses normal Linear issue status.

## Local commands

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

`/docs` is the published design-system usage documentation (Fumadocs), served from `content/docs`. The retired project routes (`/docs/project/*`, `/docs/architecture`, `/docs/sync/*`, `/docs/development/*`) still redirect to their Linear documents. The old task API returns 410 with the Linear project URL. `content/archive` and `data/tasks.json` remain as migration snapshots and should not be updated as live documentation or task state.

- `pnpm storybook`: Lit Storybook playground on http://127.0.0.1:6006
- `pnpm storybook:build`: static Storybook build
- `pnpm docs:storybook`: build Storybook and copy it to `public/storybook`, where the docs site serves and embeds it at `/storybook`
- `pnpm docs:build`: `docs:storybook` plus `pnpm build`, the production build of the docs site
- `pnpm components:build`: build `packages/components` (`@spartan/components`)
- `pnpm tokens:build`: Figma export to `tokens/source.json` to `public/tokens.css`; `pnpm tokens:check` fails when they are stale
- `pnpm test:e2e`: builds Storybook and runs real-keyboard Chromium tests
- `pnpm test`: builds the component package, then runs token, plugin, package-consumer, and historical local tracker checks
- `pnpm build`: token output, plugin bundle, component package, and the Next.js docs build
- `pnpm typecheck`: TypeScript checks
- `pnpm plugin:build`: rebuild the Figma development plugin

Import `plugin/manifest.json` into Figma. Read the [Linear plugin guide](https://linear.app/wearehaux/document/custom-figma-plugin-634833fa2f31) before use. Production tokens come from a verified export of the Spartan DS variables (`tokens/figma/README.md`); the plugin and its tests still use the isolated fixture in `tokens/fixtures/lab.json`. Real Figma runtime validation of the plugin is still pending. The first Lit components (`sp-button` and `sp-icon-button`) and Storybook live in `packages/components`; Figma parity is tracked in their Linear issues.

This directory preserves the previous workspace's pending deletions and does not restore the earlier React implementation.

## Icons in Storybook

Buttons take icons in the `start` (left) and `end` (right) slots, and any `<svg>` works. Storybook offers the licensed [Central Icons](https://iconists.co/central) set (round, outlined, radius 2, stroke 1.5, the Figma icon spec) through an **Icons** panel: search by name or keyword, then pick a left and a right icon.

- The icon package is a story-only optional dependency. Install with your license key in the environment: `CENTRAL_LICENSE_KEY=... pnpm install`. Never commit the key.
- `pnpm storybook` and `pnpm storybook:build` run `icons:generate`, which writes git-ignored `packages/components/.storybook/generated/icons.json`. Nothing from the icon set is in `src`, `dist`, or git, and the license forbids redistributing it.
- Without the package installed, stories fall back to a plain plus icon and the panel explains how to enable the library.

## Branches

`dev` is the default branch and the target for every pull request. `main` only receives releases from `dev`; see `AGENTS.md`. Both are protected by the `main and dev protection` ruleset and require the `validate` check.

## Documentation site

The docs site is Next.js with Fumadocs. Pages are MDX under `content/docs`, grouped as Getting started, Foundations, Theming, and Components, and ordered by each folder's `meta.json`. Search is a static index at `/api/search`. The site is styled with the generated `--sp-*` tokens, and its header toggle sets `data-sp-mode-semantic-color` to `Light` or `Dark`.

- Run it: `pnpm dev` (http://127.0.0.1:4310). Embeds point at `/storybook`, so run `pnpm docs:storybook` once, or set `NEXT_PUBLIC_STORYBOOK_URL=http://127.0.0.1:6006` and run `pnpm storybook`.
- Add a component page: copy `content/templates/component-page.mdx` to `content/docs/components/<name>.mdx`, add the name to `content/docs/components/meta.json`, and fill every table from the component source. Describe implemented behavior only. `tests/docs.test.ts` fails if a page lacks a title or description, embeds a story id that does not exist, or uses an em dash.
- Ownership: usage documentation lives here. Task tracking, project decisions, and workflow documents stay in Linear.

## Publishing on Vercel

There are two Vercel projects in the `iroshandezilvas-projects` team, both connected to this repository with the repo root as Root Directory. Their build settings live in the Vercel project settings, not in `vercel.json`, which only sets the install command.

| Project | Framework | Build command | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spartan-docs` (docs site, https://spartan-docs.vercel.app) | Next.js | `pnpm docs:build` | Next.js default; includes Storybook at `/storybook` |
| `spartan-storybook` (standalone Storybook) | Other | `pnpm storybook:build` | `packages/components/storybook-static` |

Both set `ignoreCommand` to skip every branch except `main`, so git deployments happen only on release. To deploy by hand from the repo root:

```sh
vercel link --project spartan-docs --scope iroshandezilvas-projects   # once; .vercel is git-ignored
vercel deploy --scope iroshandezilvas-projects                         # preview
vercel deploy --prod --scope iroshandezilvas-projects                  # production
```

Do not add `CENTRAL_LICENSE_KEY` to either project's environment while it is public. The Iconists license forbids sharing the icons publicly, so the published Storybook (including the copy under `/storybook` on the docs site) shows the plain fallback icon.
