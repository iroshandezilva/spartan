# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

@AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md is the project source of truth. Read the linked guide for the task: [.doc/project.md](.doc/project.md) for code, tokens, plugin, and Linear tracking; [.doc/figma.md](.doc/figma.md) for any Figma work.

## Repository state

- All code lives at the repository root, with its own `package.json` and `packages/components`. The old React monorepo (`apps/`, the old `packages/`, old root config) shows as deletions or replaced files in `git status`. Keep those deletions and never restore the old project.
- Root `.npmrc` (`engine-strict`) and `.node-version` (Node 26) still apply.
- The React-era CI workflows, `.github/` guides, release changesets, and the `spartan-component-builder` skill were deleted. Do not recreate them; the earlier React Linear issues are historical only.
- `doc/` holds reference captures (Attio audits). It is not part of the build. `.doc/` holds the agent guides.

## Commands

Run everything from the repository root with pnpm (the only supported package manager):

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # Next.js on http://127.0.0.1:4310
pnpm test             # node:test over tests/*.test.ts via tsx
pnpm build            # tokens:build, plugin:build, then next build --webpack
pnpm typecheck        # app tsconfig plus plugin/tsconfig.json
pnpm tokens:build     # figma export -> tokens/source.json -> public/tokens.css
pnpm tokens:check     # fail if source.json or tokens.css is stale (optionally diff a new Figma export)
pnpm plugin:build     # esbuild plugin/code.ts + ui.html -> plugin/dist
pnpm components:build # packages/components -> dist (typed exports + tokens.css)
pnpm storybook        # Lit Storybook on http://127.0.0.1:6006
pnpm test:e2e         # builds Storybook, then real-keyboard Chromium tests (Playwright)
pnpm icons:generate   # (in packages/components) licensed Central Icons -> git-ignored Storybook data
```

Run a single test file or test by name:

```sh
node --import tsx --test tests/tokens.test.ts
node --import tsx --test --test-name-pattern="aliases" tests/*.test.ts
```

## Architecture

The token pipeline feeds the Lit components in `packages/components` (`@spartan/components`: `sp-button`, `sp-icon-button`) and their Storybook.

- `tokens/figma/spartan-ds.export.json` is a verified read-only snapshot of all 461 variables in the Spartan DS Figma file (six collections). `tokens/figma/README.md` explains the collections, mode attributes, and how to refresh and diff it. `tokens/source.json` (`spartan.tokens.v2`) and `public/tokens.css` are generated from it; do not edit them by hand.
- `lib/figma-tokens.ts` is the v2 contract: import, validation, cross-collection alias resolution, mode-aware CSS (`data-sp-mode-<collection>` attributes), and drift diff. It fails explicitly on unresolved aliases, type or unit mismatches, cycles, and unsupported values.
- `lib/token-contract.ts` is the v1 contract. It still drives the custom Figma plugin and its fixture `tokens/fixtures/lab.json`, and rejects cross-collection aliases. Changes there affect the plugin and its tests.
- `plugin/code.ts` is the custom Figma plugin (no MCP). It validates input with the v1 contract, previews a diff, then applies it, persisting a token-key to Figma-ID map in root plugin data (`spartan-token-map-v1`). It cannot import the production v2 source yet. Import `plugin/manifest.json` into Figma; it has no network access.
- Storybook has an Icons panel (`.storybook/manager.tsx`) over the licensed Central Icons set, generated into a git-ignored file. Never commit icon data or the license key; see `README.md`.
- Components consume only generated `--sp-*` variables. Sizes, paddings, type, and icon sizes come from the Component and Density collections, so Relaxed and Compact density change them.
- The Next.js + Fumadocs app publishes the design-system usage docs from `content/docs` (Getting started, Foundations, Theming, Components) with static search at `/api/search`. Retired project routes redirect to Linear via `lib/linear-docs.json` (applied in `next.config.mjs`), and `app/api/tasks` returns 410. `content/archive` MDX and `data/tasks.json` are frozen migration snapshots; do not edit them as live docs or task state. `pnpm docs:build` also embeds the static Storybook at `/storybook`. Vercel projects and deploy steps are in `README.md`.

## Writing rules

- Do not use em dashes in code or docs.
- Mocked Plugin API tests and a passing build do not prove Figma runtime behavior; say so when reporting.
